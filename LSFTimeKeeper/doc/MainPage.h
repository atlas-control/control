This package provides the LSF implementation of the TimeKeeper interface, which
allows to terminate a job cleanly before the time limit is reached.

\section Usage Usage
 To activate the TimeKeeper functionality add the service LSFTimeKeeperSvc
to the ExtSvc list. Including either LSFTimeKeeperOptions.txt or
LSFTimeKeeperOptions.py to your job opts should do the trick.

\section Documentation Documentation
The code can be browsed using LXR 
(http://atlassw1.phy.bnl.gov/lxr/source/atlas/Control/LSFTimeKeeper/)

To generate doxygen doc, run (from the cmt dir) gmake doxygen and point 
your browser to .../doc/Doxygen/html/index.html
