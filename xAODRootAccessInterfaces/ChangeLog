	* As it turns out, I managed to introduce a very stupid mistake
	  in the previous update into the template code.
	* The issue was discovered/discussed on ATLASG-249
	* Tagging as xAODRootAccessInterfaces-00-00-07

	* Added an optional parameter to the TVirtualEvent::retrieve
	  functions to make them fail silently. This was needed to be
	  able to implement the ElementLink<...>::isValid() and
	  DataLink<...>::isValid() functions such that they wouldn't
	  print warnings under any circumstance.
	* This meant adding a new parameter to one of the pure virtual
	  functions defined in TVirtualEvent as well.

2014-08-27 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Added a new helper value, xAOD::TVirtualEvent::KEY_MASK. It is
	  used in the code to identify default ElementLink/DataLink keys.
	  Under some circumstances these become not zero, but 0x3fffffff.

	* Extended the TVirtualEvent interface a little further, so it
	  would become possible to implement the dataID() functions in
	  AthLinks in standalone mode.

2014-04-30 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Changed the variable/function names of the classes to adhere to
	  the Athena naming rules. The class names still begin with "T",
	  but as far as I know that's not against the ATLAS coding rules.

	* Tagging xAODRootAccessInterfaces-00-00-02.
	* cmt/requirements: (new)

2014-01-29 Attila Krasznahorkay <Attila.Krasznahorkay@cern.ch>
	* Created this very light-weight package for holding the
	  classes that AthLinks needs. So that AthLinks would not need
	  to depend on all the packages that xAODRootAccess depends on.
	* Tagging as xAODRootAccessInterfaces-00-00-01
